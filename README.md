# Supervised Learning Model Comparison

This project compares three classic supervised learning models —
**k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**, **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, and **Neural Networks (NN)** —
across two real-world datasets:
- **Bankruptcy Prediction**
- **Cancer Severity Classification**

---

## Overview
The goal is to understand how model choice and hyperparameters affect performance,
training time, and generalization across different domains.

Each model was trained using a 70/30 split with 5-fold cross-validation and standardized preprocessing.

---

## Key Findings
- All models performed similarly on the **bankruptcy** dataset due to class imbalance.  
- **Neural networks** achieved the highest accuracy on the **cancer** dataset.  
- **SVM** provided the best balance between accuracy and efficiency.
